// A data type where you can store values like â€” {int, double, string, int[]} . So to create such a data type we use Struct

// Also now that you have seen how we can use struct to create such data types the doubt that
// comes to our mind is that can't we use classes to do the same
// The answer to this is yes we can use classes to do the same and in fact it even better to use classes to do the same
// because classes have more features than structs can offer.
